ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paulius â€“ an MSc Artificial Intelligence graduate (Distinction) and Software Engineer passionate about machine learning, intelligent systems, and automation.

ðŸ§  My interests lie at the intersection of representation learning, explainable AI, and 3D machine learning. Iâ€™m particularly excited about building intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and interact with the real world.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Java Engineer, developing real-time systems for global online platforms using Java 21, Spring. I also build internal tools in Python to automate workflowsâ€”some of which reduced tasks from 1 day to 5 minutes.

ðŸ“Š Previously, I developed a novel ML models performed data analysis and visualisation.

ðŸ“š My masterâ€™s research focused on spiking neural network learning methods, exploring REINFORCE and genetic algorithms to go beyond standard gradient descent.

ðŸ§ª Exploring:

    3D semantic scene understanding

    Generative models for 3D data

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

    Python ML frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch)

    Reinforcement Learning

ðŸ“‚ Check out my repos for machine learning experiments, automation tools, and visualizations.

ðŸŒ± Always learning. Always building. Open to research collaborations and PhD opportunities in cutting-edge AI.
